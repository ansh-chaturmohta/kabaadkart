# Kabaad Kart


KabaadKart is a startup which tries to solve the problem of waste management and handling. To use this, one has to download the app and provide their address along with what scrap they want to sell, the workers of KabaadKart reach the location and collect the scrap and pay them accordingly. I made a website for this startup while I was working at Caerus Infotech solutions.
